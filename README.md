# JSObserver

JSObserver is a system for studying the JavaScript global identifier conflict problems. It records JavaScript global function definitions, the writes to a memory location and the calls to JavaScript functions.

JSObserver is implemented on Chromium (version 71.0.3578.98).

You can find more information about JSObserver in our [ESEC/FSE 2020 research paper](https://seclab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/papers/fse20_js_conflict.pdf).

## Setup and Build
The following build script works only on Debian, Ubuntu and macOS.

```shell
# Install depot_tools
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools

# Fetch source and build
./build_jsobserver.sh --all
```

The above command will fetch the source code of Chromium version 71.0.3578.98, apply our patch to it, and build JSObserver.

For more information about the options, use:

```shell
./build_jsobserver.sh --help
```

When building on macOS, you might need to install an older version of MacOS SDK included by Xcode, e.g., MacOS SDK10.14 included by Xcode 10.0.
The SDKs are available [here](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs).

The pre-built version of JSObserver is available [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3923232), with a DOI of __10.5281/zenodo.3923232__.

## Run on Linux

```shell
cd src
out/Release/chrome --no-sandbox
```

## Run on macOS

```shell
cd src
out/Release/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --no-sandbox
```

## Data Availability

The collected dataset in total requires over 3TB of disk space. 

Therefore, we only released the log files on websites where we detected conflicts.
Further, we only keep *.script files on websites where we detected function definition conflicts, as the *.script files were used to identify duplicate function definition and duplicate script inclusion.
We also sampled 100 websites on which we did not detect any conflict.

The dataset collected by JSObserver is available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3874944), with a DOI of __10.5281/zenodo.3874944__.


## Data Collection

We provide our data collection script in the *scripts* folder.
You will need to update line 25 in collect_logs.py to the local path of chromium binary file.
The top-1m.csv file can be downloaded from Alexa.

```shell
cd scripts
python collect_logs.py -u iso -d [LOG_DIR] -s [START_RANK] -e [END_RANK] -p [NUM_PROCESS] -n [NUM_INSTANCE]

# Example usage
python collect_logs.py -u iso -d jsobserver -s 1 -e 1000 -p 256 -n 2048
```
The above command will collect logs on Alexa top 1K websites using 256 processes and 2048 instances. Collected log files will be saved in folder *jsobserver*.

For more information about the options, use:

```shell
cd scripts
python collect_logs.py --help
```


## Data Format
The format of different log files are  described below.
We record all writes in JavaScript to a memory location and dump the logs in _[rank].[main/sub].[frame\_cnt].asg_ (e.g., 1.main.0.asg) files. 

* Function call logs: 
  - ["is\_call"], [function\_name], [script\_ID], [timestamp], [position\_of\_call\_expression], ["---"], ["---"], ["---"], [frame\_ID]
  - ["is\_call\_new"], [function\_name], [script\_ID], [timestamp], [position\_of\_call\_expression], ["---"], ["---"], ["---"], [frame\_ID]
 
* Write operation logs:
  - [assign\_ID], [LHS\_string], [RHS\_string], [RHS\_type], [script\_ID], [position\_of\_expression], [timestamp], [typeof\_LHS], [valueof\_LHS], [target\_ID], [LHS\_ID], [frame\_ID]

* __Additional notes:__
   - For a call in new operators, e.g., *var obj = new myConstructor()*, the first entry would be "is\_call\_new"; for a normal function call, e.g., *var ret = myFunc()*, the first entry is "is\_call".
   - For a write to an object property, e.g., *obj.key = value*, [target\_ID] is the unique ID of *obj*, and [LHS\_ID] is the unique ID of *obj.key*
   - For a write to a simple identifier, e.g., *var myVar = value*, if the type of myVar is *object*, then [valueof\_LHS], [target\_ID] and [LHS\_ID] are all the unique ID of *myVar*; if myVar is of primitive type, [valueof\_LHS] is the primitive type value, [target\_ID] will be "---", and [LHS\_ID] is the unique ID of *myVar*.
   - Possible values of [RHS\_type] include: "rhs\_is\_number", "rhs\_is\_string", "rhs\_is\_undefined", "rhs\_is\_null", "rhs\_is\_bool", "rhs\_is\_expression", "rhs\_is\_var", "rhs\_is\_prop", "rhs\_is\_new" and "rhs\_is\_call".
   - The above entries in each log are separated by ",elem_js_conflict,", and "---" refers to a dummy entry value.

We record all JavaScript global function definitions _[rank].[main/sub].[frame\_cnt].func_ (e.g., 1.main.0.func) files.

* [function\_name], [definition\_start\_position], [definition\_end\_position], [script\_URL], [timestamp], [script\_ID], [frame\_ID]
* __Additional note:__ The above entries in each log are separated by "\t".

We record a map from script IDs to script URLs _[rank].[main/sub].[frame\_cnt].id2url_ (e.g., 1.main.0.id2url) files.

* [script\_ID], [script\_URL]
* __Additional note:__ The above entries in each log are separated by "," (COMMA).

We record the URL of all frames (i.e., the main frame and all iframes) in _[rank].[main/sub].[frame\_cnt].frame_ (e.g., 1.main.0.frame) files.

* Main frame URL logs:
  - ["main"], [main\_frame\_URL], [timestamp]
* Iframe URL logs:
  - ["sub"], [iframe\_frame\_URL], [timestamp]
* __Additional note:__ The above entries in each log are separated by " " (SPACE).

We saved the source code of scripts in _[rank].[main/sub].[frame\_cnt].[script\_ID].script_ (e.g., 1.main.0.17.script) files.

* The first line of the file is the script URL. The rest are the source code of the script.


## Data Analysis

We provide the data analysis scripts in folder *scripts*.
The dependencies are specified in *scripts/requirements.txt*. Please install them before running the scripts.
To fully automate the analysis, you may change *LOG_DIR* in *analysis.sh* to your local folder where you want to save the log files, and *SCRIPT_DIR* to the local path of the *scripts* folder.
You can further configure *START*, *END*, *NUM\_PROCESSE*S and *NUM\_INSTANCES* in *analysis.sh*. Then use:

```shell
cd scripts
./analysis.sh
```

The above command will execute the following python scripts. You may comment some of them to avoid redoing some computation.

* parse_logs\_using\_ids.py: parse *.asg log files to extract write operation information and function calls
* func-parse\_logs.py: parse *.func log files to extract function definitions
* func-detect\_conflicts.py: detect function definition conflicts from *.func files
* preprocess\_conflicts\_using\_ids.py: exclude conflicts involving tmp variables injected by JSObserver
* extract\_rank2urls.py: extract website URLs from *.frame files
* categorize\_conflicts.py: classify detected conflicts based on the domain name of conflicting scripts
* summarize\_conflicts.py: merge all detected conflicts into a single JSON file
* check\_conflict\_var\_usage\_using\_ids.py: search for function calls after the overwrite of function definitions
* summarize\_used\_conflicts.py: merge all function definition conflicts where the function was called after being redefined
* parallel\_select\_duplicate\_funcs.py: identify duplicate function definitions
* summarize\_duplicate\_funcs.py: compute statistics about duplicate function definitions
* parallel\_select\_duplicate\_scripts.py: identify duplicate scripts on a website
* summarize\_duplicate\_funcs.py: compute statistics about duplicate script inclusion
* compute\_all\_stats.py: compute all statistics about detected conflicts

For more information about the options, use: 

```shell
python [script_name] --help

# Example
python parse_logs_using_ids.py --help
```

The analysis scripst are also released [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3923232).
